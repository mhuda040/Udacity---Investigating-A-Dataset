# Udacity---Investigating-A-Dataset
In this project, we will analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.

For this project, we investigate a dataset listing movies from The Movie Database. This dataset contains over 10,000 entries, including movie titles, movie budgets, year of release, cast members, directors, and user ratings. We will use Python functionality to extract this data and share the findings. Among the issues:
- Which movies had the most profit at the box office? Which movies had the least profit?
- Which movies had the large budget? Which movies had a small budget?
- Which movies achieved a high return on investment (i.e., revenue)? Which movies achieved a low return on investment?
- Which movies had the longest runtime? Which movies had the shortest?
- Which year brought the most profit for the box office?
- Which movie genre was the most successful?
- What is the average budget, revenue, and runtime for the movies?
